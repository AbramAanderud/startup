## HTML Notes

- Took IS 201 so some of this is review but I forgot how to add videos and some other things
- you can use the live server to see the changes as you do them
- I was confused about how simon is deployed but we are deploying the base simon to our app and then we are deploying our start up too
- was confused because the default on my site was taking back to the 260 simon
- the simon html has been really helpful
- I can put shapes to show what the room may look like, looked up shape formatting for the room.
- I think I am now going to make the room weather reactive.
- Learned that you can pull fonts off the internet with css as long as you have the url
- Using flex and some other built in styling on css you can make your website fit anything but it is important to make sure you arent flexing wrong
- You can debug css by inspecting the thing that is wrong in the browser to have a better idea of the issue
- You can use bootstraps to basically speed run making a website
