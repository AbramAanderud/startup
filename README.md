# Room

[My Notes](notes.md)

I am making a virtual chat room where you create a simple small character and can walk around and talk to others in the room. There will be objects you can interract with that others will be able to see. Thinking something like a post it board and buying others drinks.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

- Interactive Space: walk around and interact with objects

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Structure the hub layout with sections for seating areas, bar counters, and customizable avatars.
- **CSS** - Create a nice, chill aesthetic with quality colors, smooth animations, and responsive design for screen sizes.
- **React** - Build a dynamic single-page application with reusable components like the avatar editor, menu, and chat window. Ill also use React Router to manage navigation between spaces.
- **Service** - Call external APIs for random trivia questions or weather-based Room themes using the OpenWeather API
- **DB/Login** - Store user profiles, items, and chat logs in DB. Track virtual currency balances for purchasing items.
- **WebSocket** - Enable real-time messaging for chats and emote triggers. Broadcast special announcements like event updates or limited-time specials.

- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - Used headers, footers, main, div and nav to seperate elements and display information.
- [x] **Links** - Linked my github and there is easy page navigation through links
- [x] **Text** - added text place holders explaining what everything will be and where I will put it. 
- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - I am going to use a weather api to change the way the room looks. 
- [x] **Images** - Image in there as a placeholder for the character design, ill add images as decorations to the room later.

- [x] **DB data placeholder** - This will be seen with the gold counter and leaderboard as well as the current log of chats that is being stored.

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Navigation elements** - The EXIT button on the room in the top left and the login button is on the index page.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - Made the room window dynamic so it resizes but the inside content is fixed inside the container so it seems more like a real virtual room. The chat box and buttons stay in the corner for easy access. 
- [x] **Application elements** - Added the room and gold counter will probably add a player list. Added a bar and some tables with little cushion chairs. Might try and design more and add a bar tender.
